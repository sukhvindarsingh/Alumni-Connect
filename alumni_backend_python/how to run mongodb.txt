Open Command Prompt 1: Run mongod --dbpath "C:\data\db"

Open Command Prompt 2: Navigate to your backend folder, activate venv, and run python app.py

That's it for the essentials. You only open mongosh or Compass if you specifically need to look at or manipulate data directly outside of your backend application.
